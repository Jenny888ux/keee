# What is it?

A base library containing:

- Types and classes about discrete and continuous geometry, collision detection,
animated UIs, animated colored text and easing functions.

- Containers (Graph, Matrix, Cyclic matrix, Dynamic vector, etc...)

- 8-bit color manipulation in different color spaces

- Rectangular frame morphing.

- Physics

- Rendering backends:
   - In a GLFW-driven OpenGL window
   - Delta-rendering in the terminal, to avoid screen tearing

- UI components building blocks

- Player input, window management.

- demo-application on text animation, `imj-base-examples-exe` :

The initial idea for delta rendering is based on
