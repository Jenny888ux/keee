# Backlog

## Misc.

- use hspec for testing

- provide "nice" default colors (notion of palette?)

## Geometry

- take into account the fact that character width and height are not equal,
so geometric figures are stretched in height. We could compensate for that by using
a stretching factor in poly function and circle function

## Playability
- it seems that the console has a fixed refresh rate of 21 fps, so if we render an a slightly different fps
there will be every once in a while a frame than will be slow (as if a frame was skipped) for animations.
It would be nice to synchronize animation exactly with console fps to have a better fluidity

## Games to implement:
- make a brick-breaking game
- make a tower based defense game
- make a pong

- Play multiple games at once
