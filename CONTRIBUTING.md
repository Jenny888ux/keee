Contributions are welcome!

Here are some general guidelines:

- The preferred way of discussing a future contribution is by opening a github issue.

- When submitting a PR, please make sure that `stack test --pedantic` is successful.

- The CI tests verify compatibility with ghc 8.2.2 onwards. CI tests should be green in order
for the PR to be mergeable.


- `BACKLOG.md` is where I store ideas on what to do next. At some point I will
go through that and create relevant github issues.
If you want to work on one of them, feel free to pick one! Older items may not be relevant anymore,
if in doubt you can ask me.

- I also have a number of `TODO`s in the code, which are issues of smaller size
than those in the Backlog.
