Contributions are welcome!

Here are some guidelines:

- When submitting a PR, please make sure that `stack test --pedantic` is successful.

- The CI tests verify compatibility with ghc 8.0.2 onwards. CI tests should be green in order
for the PR to be mergeable.

- You can discuss with me beforehand about the contribution you want to make,
preferably by opening a github issue.

- There are a number of `TODO` in the code, which I /try/ to keep up-to-date.
If you want to be work on one of them, and want to be sure that the `TODO` is
indeed a /real/ `TODO`, do not hesitate to ask me beforehand.
