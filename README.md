# What is it?

A terminal ascii game I write to practice some Haskell!

# Backlog

- the balls that go faster should be drawn more frequently
- handle repeated keys by not making the game fast forward
- ship with laser

- make a brick-breaking game
- make a tower based defense game
- make a pong

- Play multiple games at once
