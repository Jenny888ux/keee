# What is it?

A minimal working example of a multiplayer game built using `imj-engine`.

In this game, each player increments a global counter by pressing the space bar, and
the counter value is displayed in the center of the screen.

For a more advanced (and fun :-) ) multi-player game made using `imj-game`, see `imj-game-hamazed`.
