- in renderer, add the possibility to just change a color (fg or bg), just change a char.
  - use it to create end level effects : draw everything with '.' or '+' except the winning message
  and the messages on the left.
  - when laser is shot, make a circle expanding, where chars are overridden by '+' or
  color is overridden.
- cross-dissolve between worlds, to have smooth transitions (especially important
  when there are walls)

- when frame morphs, it should be centered in the screen, hence:
use an evolution to replace the ship in the center, morph, then use another
evolution to place the ship where it is in the next world.

- scissors should be combinable : we need a stack of scissors.

- Measure if O2 is necessary, especially for:
  - particle systems with a lot of points
  - delta renderer
compilation times are slower by 4% with -O2.

- for stackage, which ghc versions should I support? https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2014/05/stackage-server
