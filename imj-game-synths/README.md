# What is it?

A game where players collaboratively create a piece of music.

Every player connected to the same server will hear the same music, i.e the music
played by other players along with its own, generated by key presses on the computer
keyboard.

# Controls

- Notes can be played, like on a piano keyboard, but using the computer keyboard.
- Loops can be created by hitting the space key.

# Development

- Ideas I'd like to implement include:
  - Loops synchronization
  - Loop delete/mute/unmute
  - Change the length / start of a loop after it's created
  - Possibility to quantize the notes of a loop
  - Output the result as a .wav
  - Save / restore a project
  - Make loop mute / unmute a time parameter.
  - Visual feedback of a project execution using tracks.
