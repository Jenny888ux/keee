= Purpose
Render games or animations in the console, without
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing screen tearing>.

= Design goals
* Use generic techniques to avoid
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing screen tearing> for all kinds of
game graphics.
* Minimize memory footprint and run-time overhead.

= Features
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit 8-bit colors> support
* <http://www.unicode.org/ Unicode> support

= How it started

In the beginnings of
<https://github.com/OlivierSohn/hamazed my first ascii based game>,
the render loop was as na√Øve as:

* Clear the console.
* Render the game elements to the console directly.
* Flush stdout.

It worked well whilst a frame was ~100 different locations in a single color.

As color animations were introduced, flickering / tearing
effects started to occur on frames with more rendering locations, because stdout was saturated by
rendering commands and would flush before all commands corresponding to this frame were issued.

To fix this I maximized the size of stdout buffer by using
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/System-IO.html#v:hSetBuffering hSetBuffering>
with
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/System-IO.html#v:BlockBuffering BlockBuffering>
parameter.

(Note that to measure the actual stdout size you can use 'testStdoutSizes'),

> hSetBuffering stdout $ BlockBuffering $ Just (maxBound :: Int)

This solved the problem, only until more animations and more color changes were introduced.

To fix <https://github.com/feuerbach/ansi-terminal/issues/5 this issue>,
<https://github.com/ibraimgm Rafael Ibraim> shared
<https://gist.github.com/ibraimgm/40e307d70feeb4f117cd a solution using double buffering>
where the render loop is:

* Clear the back buffer.
* Draw the game elements to the back buffer.
* Render the difference between the front and the back buffer to the console.
* Flush stdout.
* Copy the back buffer to the front buffer.

This approach fixed the rendering of my game.

Still, I wanted to continue improving it, to cover more use-cases.
So I added the following optimizations:

* On average, one @color change@ command "costs" 20 bytes ("\ESC[48;5;167;38;5;255m").
Grouping the rendered locations by color allows to issue one command for the group
instead of one per element, thus saving (at most) 20 bytes per rendered location.

* On average, one @position change@ command "costs" 9 bytes ("\ESC[150;42H").
Sorting the "color group" by positions increases the likelyhood that
two consecutive elements are next to one another. In that case we can omit this
command, because after a 'putChar' the cursor location goes one step to the
right. (More to come on this subject, cf. the BACKLOG)

* And
<https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellquestions/comments/7i6hi5/optimizing_memory_usage_array_of_unboxed_values/
I found usefull answers on reddit> which helped in the process of optimizing
the memory layout. Contiguous memory blocks are mow used to store information
on rendered locations, and we use an Unboxed 'Word64', which is the most efficient Haskell type in terms of
"information qty / memory usage" ratio, to encode (from
higher bits to lower bits):

    * background color  (Word8)
    * foreground color  (Word8)
    * buffer position   (Word16)
    * unicode character (Word32)

Finally, if this module doesn't play well with your game graphics, let me know!
Maybe we'll need more optimizations options in the future, to adapt more closely
to the various kind of graphics that can be used in games.

= Usage

TODO stats on hamazed to see stdout buffer usage

-- TODO hide the render size API, replace it by an optional Initialize function
which will allocate the buffers

-- TODO provide a context which we can create using TerminalSize or CustomSize,
it contains the IORef, the buffers.

Setup the frame size. You can use
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/terminal-size#readme terminal-size package>
to retrieve the current size of the terminal.

> setFrameDimensions 300 90

Draw

> setForegroundColor $ xterm256ColorToCode $ RGBColor $ RGB 0 2 3
> setDrawLocation 10 20
> drawStr "Hello world!"

Render to the console

> renderFrame True {-reset the back buffer to the initial colors-}

= Global states

The functions of this module are in the IO monad because a top level
IORef is used to store states : current colors, current draw position,
front and back buffers, and internal buffers.

TODO should this module handle cursor hiding?

-- TODO include in this module functions to create colors to be able to write
